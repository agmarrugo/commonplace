> “It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn’t. They kept going, because they were holding on to something. That there is some good in this world, and it's worth fighting for.”

Al final del día, todo se reduce a eso, a lo que defendemos. Todos anhelamos lo mismo que Sam: amor, un jardín, un hogar cálido, amigos, una buena conversación acompañada de una cerveza. Sin embargo, también debemos remangarnos y enfrentar la tarea, como lo hizo Sam.

La belleza de estas citas reside en la esperanza que ofrecen en momentos de dificultad, recordándonos que la fuerza está en aquello que amamos. Lo que amamos nos convierte en mejores esposos, mejores padres y mejores ciudadanos.
